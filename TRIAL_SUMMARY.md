# Project Trial Summary

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a research tool that leverages the Exa API to gather and synthesize information. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface for conducting research and visualizing the results.

## Integration with Exa
The project integrates with the Exa API to perform searches and retrieve relevant information based on user queries. This integration is handled within the `deep-research` module.

## Currently Working Parts
- Basic integration with the Exa API for searching.
- A frontend interface (`company-researcher`) to input queries and display initial results.

## Next Steps
- Enhance the frontend to better visualize and interact with the research results (e.g., mind mapping).
- Improve the research logic in `deep-research` to handle more complex queries and synthesize information more effectively.
- Implement features for saving and managing research sessions.

## Folder Structure
- `deep-research/`: This directory contains the core logic for interacting with the Exa API and performing the research. It is designed to be a reusable module for deep research tasks.
- `company-researcher/`: This directory contains the Next.js application that provides the user interface for the research tool. It consumes the functionality provided by the `deep-research` module.
